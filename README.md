# Speed-Dating
Projet Tinder
The goal of this project is to use the "Speed Dating" dataset from Tinder (available in the datasets folder) and do some EDA on it. 
Using different Python librairies, I'll try to answer the following questions :

- What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
- How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
- Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
- Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
- In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?

The project is divided in two notebooks, the data cleaning/preparation (1_cleaning.ipynb) and the visualisation (2_analysis.ipynb).

Below you will find the according presentation (in frenglish), resuming the exploration done on this dataset.
